The MyToken smart contract is a basic implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens, maintaining a mapping of addresses to token balances, and storing essential token details such as the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Contract Details

Public Variables
Token Name: tokenName - The name of the token, which is set to "savingsOfMembers".
Token Abbreviation: symbol - The abbreviation of the token, which is set to "SM".
Total Supply: totalSaving - The total supply of the token, which is dynamically updated as tokens are minted and burned.

Mappings
Balances: balances - A mapping from an address to the balance of tokens held by that address.

Functions

Mint Function
The mint function allows for the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters: an address (member) and an amount (amount). This function increases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the specified address.

Burn Function
The burn function allows for the destruction of tokens. It takes two parameters: an address (from) and an amount (amount). This function decreases the total supply of the token and updates the balance of the specified address. The function includes a conditional check to ensure that the address has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount.
